# Stocks

This is my first android app. It is a work in progress.

## To Do
* User input to show user defined stock and time range
	* Update StockHistoryAdapter contructors to include parameters for symbol & time range
	* Pull stock symbols for easy user selection (Need to decide on API to use...)
	* Add defined time ranges for user selection
* Display current stock price and change this text when user scrubs
* List of user saved stocks
	* Show list on homepage
	* Pull stock data on startup for entire list

## Built With
* [Spark](https://github.com/robinhood/spark)
* [Finance Quotes API for Yahoo Finance](https://github.com/sstrickx/yahoofinance-api)
